# ðŸ“¸ Viewport Capture

The Arc browser can easily capture an entire page. It can also easily caputure sections of pages. I wanted to capture just what's currently in the viewport.

Existing extensions do much more than I need. I'm sure I could have found one that'd do the job, but it wasn't worth the time spent hunting.

So I banged this lil guy out. It was actually easier than I'd expected.
