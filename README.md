# ðŸ“¸ Viewport Capture

The Arc browser can easily capture an entire page. It can also easily caputure sections of pages. I wanted to capture just what's currently in the viewport. I wanted to be able to do this quickly and easily.

Existing extensions do more than I need. It wasn't worth the time spent hunting for the right one.

Easy enough to bang this lil guy out.
